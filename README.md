# Identity Assertion Registry

## Purpose
To support critical infrastructure needs with an auditable and authoritative registry of digital identify proofs in accordance with industry guidelines and recommendations.

## Standards
The following resources are considered applicable and relevant to the orientation and goals of this project:
- [Digital Identity Guidelines (NIST SP 800-63A)](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html)
- [Key validity and owner trust (GnuPG)](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x334.html)

## Getting Started
1. Familiarize yourself with the resources provided in the Standards section above
2. Refer to the [identity registry](/registry/) for existing evidence submissions (see also [schema](/SCHEMA.md))
3. Review all [contributing policies](/COMPLIANCE.md) in effect on this repository
4. Create a new pull request to submit evidence for a new or existing digital identity
