**Abstract**

This paper outlines a proof of concept for a privacy-preserving identity verification system based on NIST SP 800-63A requirements. The proposed system leverages cryptographic techniques, including zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), tokenization of evidence attributes, and a public evidence map (analogous to a public key) to verify identity without disclosing personally identifiable information (PII). This framework aligns with the goals outlined in the Identity Registry project hosted at https://github.com/mattborja/identity.

**Introduction**

In an era where digital identity verification is critical for secure interactions, ensuring privacy and minimizing the exposure of PII remain significant challenges. Current systems often require the sharing of sensitive information, increasing risks associated with data breaches and identity theft. This paper proposes a novel system that verifies identity using cryptographic proofs without revealing the underlying PII. The system integrates zero-knowledge proofs, tokenization, and decentralized identity frameworks to provide a scalable, secure, and privacy-preserving solution.

**System Description**

The Privacy-Preserving Identity Verification System is a cryptographically secure framework designed to verify the validity of an individual’s identity attributes without exposing sensitive information. The system operates by tokenizing identity attributes into cryptographic representations (evidence tokens) and aggregating them into a public evidence map, which serves as a reference for verification. Leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, the system enables the identity holder to prove possession of valid identity attributes without disclosing the underlying data.

Core features include:
- **Privacy Preservation:** Personally identifiable information is never shared with the verifier.
- **Scalability:** Efficient proof generation and verification enable use across diverse platforms and large user bases.
- **Interoperability:** The system aligns with standards such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and ISO/IEC 29115 for identity assurance.
- **Security:** The system employs cryptographic techniques, such as zk-SNARKs and tamper-proof ledgers, to ensure tamper resistance and reliable validation of identity claims.

**Relevance to NIST SP 800-63B**

This system aligns closely with the Digital Authentication Guidelines outlined in NIST SP 800-63B by providing a robust, privacy-preserving mechanism for identity verification:

1. **Cryptographic Proofs as Authenticators:** The use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) serves as a cryptographic authenticator, enabling secure verification of the identity holder without disclosing sensitive information. This approach aligns with SP 800-63B’s emphasis on cryptographic-based authentication mechanisms.

2. **Binding Identity to Authentication:** By securely binding the private key (representing the identity) to tokenized attributes, the system ensures strong association between the identity holder and their verified identity attributes, meeting SP 800-63B requirements for binding authenticators to subscriber identities.

3. **Resistance to Replay and Phishing Attacks:** Dynamic challenge-response mechanisms within the ZKP framework provide inherent protection against replay attacks and phishing attempts, as stipulated in SP 800-63B.

4. **Minimizing Exposure of Sensitive Information:** SP 800-63B emphasizes limiting the collection, transmission, and retention of sensitive information. This system adheres to that principle by ensuring that PII is never disclosed to the verifier during authentication or verification processes.

5. **Support for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** While the current implementation focuses on single-factor cryptographic proofs, it can be extended to include additional factors (e.g., biometrics, possession-based tokens) to achieve higher authentication assurance levels (AALs).

**System Architecture**

The proposed system consists of four core components:

1. **Identity Holder (Prover):** The entity requesting verification, holding a private identity key and evidence tokens.

2. **Verification Authority (Verifier):** The entity performing the verification without access to sensitive information.

3. **Token Registry (Public Evidence Map):** A cryptographically secure registry mapping tokenized attributes to the identity holder.

4. **Verification Proof (Signature):** A cryptographic proof generated by the identity holder to demonstrate validity without exposing PII.

**Methodology**

### Identity Initialization

1. **Private Key Generation:**
   - The identity holder generates a private key (“SK”) derived from their PII:

     $$SK = H(\text{PII})$$

     where $H$ is a secure hash function.

2. **Tokenization of Attributes:**
   - Identity attributes are hashed individually to produce evidence tokens:

     $$ET_i = H(\text{Attribute}_i)$$

3. **Public Key Aggregation:**
   - Tokens are aggregated into a public key (evidence map):

     $$PK = H(ET_1 \| ET_2 \| \ldots \| ET_n)$$

     where $\|$ denotes concatenation.

### Signature Creation

The identity holder generates a proof by combining the private key and evidence tokens using a zero-knowledge proof mechanism:

$$S = \text{Prove}(SK, ET_1, ET_2, \ldots, ET_n)$$

This proof ensures that the verifier learns nothing beyond the validity of the claim.

### Verification

1. **Input:** The verifier receives the public key (PK), the proof (S), and optional challenge data.

2. **Verification Function:**
   - The verifier computes:
     
     $$V = \text{Verify}(PK, S, \text{Challenge})$$

3. **Output:** If $V = \text{true}$, the verifier confirms the validity of the tokens and their association with the identity holder.

**Implementation Details**

### Cryptographic Foundations

1. **Hash Functions:** Use SHA-256 or a similar cryptographic hash function for tokenization and key generation.
2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Implement zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs for efficient and privacy-preserving proof generation.
3. **Ledger for Token Registry:** Store public keys (evidence maps) in a tamper-proof decentralized ledger, such as a blockchain.

### Standards Integration

1. **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Employ DIDs to manage identity attributes in a decentralized manner.
2. **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Use VCs to represent evidence tokens and enable interoperability across verification systems.
3. **ISO/IEC 29115:** Align with identity assurance levels (IALs) to ensure consistency with industry-recognized identity frameworks.

**Example Use Case: Employment Verification**

1. **Initialization:**
   - A job applicant generates a private key based on their PII and tokenizes attributes such as email and phone.
   - The aggregated public key is stored in the token registry.

2. **Proof Generation:**
   - The applicant signs a challenge from the employer using their private key and evidence tokens, generating a proof.

3. **Verification:**
   - The employer verifies the proof against the public key in the registry. If the proof is valid, the applicant’s identity is confirmed without exposing PII.

**Security and Privacy Analysis**

1. **Privacy Preservation:**
   - PII is never shared with the verifier, minimizing exposure risks.

2. **Tamper Resistance:**
   - The use of cryptographic hashes and a decentralized ledger ensures that tokens and public keys cannot be altered.

3. **Scalability:**
   - ZKP mechanisms provide efficient proof generation and verification, enabling scalability across large user bases.

**Conclusion and Future Work**

This proof of concept demonstrates a privacy-preserving identity verification system that aligns with modern cryptographic standards and privacy requirements. Unlike existing privacy-preserving verification methods, this system uniquely integrates zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) with tokenization to create verifiable claims that are tamper-resistant and fully interoperable with frameworks like Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Its ability to operate without disclosing PII while supporting multi-factor authentication and decentralized ledger technologies sets it apart as a forward-looking solution for secure identity verification. Future work includes implementing the system on a decentralized ledger, integrating with existing identity frameworks, and conducting scalability testing in real-world scenarios.
