# Inference Papers
In legal contexts, an **inference** is a logical conclusion that a factfinder (such as a judge or jury) can reasonably draw from the evidence presented, even if the conclusion is not explicitly proven by direct evidence. Inferences must be based on rational reasoning and the presented circumstantial evidence.
