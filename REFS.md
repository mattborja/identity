## About Classifications

- **Institutional Proofs**: Many of the examples like the driver's license, voter ID, and insurance cards are **institutional** because they are issued by recognized entities (government, private insurance, or service providers) to confirm the subject’s identity, qualifications, or rights.
  
- **Content-Based Proofs**: Utility bills, mortgage statements, and project involvement fall under **content-based proofs** because they provide evidence of specific actions, locations, or financial status through records that the subject may not directly control but can be verified through other systems or organizations.

- **Communication Proofs**: The S/MIME email example fits under **communication** since it involves the subject's email address, and cryptographic methods are used to confirm identity and message integrity.

- **Institutional proofs** generally involve some form of external validation through an issuing body (e.g., government, healthcare provider, or employer).
- **Content-based proofs** rely on records that document specific actions or information related to the subject, such as utility bills, project timestamps, and financial statements.
