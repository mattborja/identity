# Usage: keyversion.sh <filename>
#
# Checks the key fingerprint length from a JSON file and determines its corresponding key version.
# If the key length matches a deprecated version (e.g., 128-bit for version 3), a warning is displayed.
#
# Please note:
# - As of July 2024, RFC9580 ยง5.5.4.1 specifies that "version 3 (128-bit) keys and MD5 are deprecated" (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9580#section-5.5.4.1)
# - As of December 2022, NIST has retired SHA-1 with an expected full withdrawal date of December 31, 2030 (https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/12/nist-retires-sha-1-cryptographic-algorithm)
